# Results and output inference 

A few sample output images are provided in the demo/images/ folder — feel free to check them out yourself! Each output shows the input image with a predicted class label and bounding box, alongside the FPGA vs CPU latency, FPS, confidence score, and speedup. The Conv1 and Conv2 feature maps are also visualized, showing how the network processes the image layer by layer.
