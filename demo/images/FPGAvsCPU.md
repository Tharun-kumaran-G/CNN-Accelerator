## 🧠 The Key Lesson — Speed ≠ Accuracy

The CPU is **6.6× faster** and **100% confident** — and completely wrong.

The FPGA is slower and only 55% confident — and **got the right answer**.

```
Ground Truth:  🐕 DOG

FPGA   →  Dog  ✅  150ms   55% conf   ← CORRECT
CPU    →  Cat  ❌   14ms  100% conf   ← WRONG, confidently
```

> **High confidence does not mean correct.** It means the model strongly committed to a decision. In this case the CPU committed hard to the wrong class.

---

## 🔍 Why Did the CPU Get It Wrong?

The CPU forward pass uses **float32 weights** — higher numerical precision than the FPGA's INT8. But more precision doesn't mean better generalization.

The float32 model likely **overfit** to specific texture/edge features in training that associate pointed ears and dark fur with cats. When it sees this black German Shepherd at 64×64 grayscale resolution, those same features fire strongly — and the model confidently outputs Cat.

The FPGA's **INT8 quantization** acts like slight regularization — the rounding of weight values smooths out some of the overfitting, and in this case that actually helped the model generalize correctly to the dog.

```
Float32 precision  →  memorizes fine-grained patterns  →  overfits  →  Cat ❌
INT8 quantization  →  slightly smoothed weights         →  generalizes →  Dog ✅
```

This is a real-world example of why quantized models sometimes **outperform** their float32 counterparts on out-of-distribution or edge-case images.

## ✅ Final Verdict

| Dimension | Winner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Correct Classification** | 🏆 **FPGA** | Dog ✅ vs Cat ❌ — only one that matters |
| Speed | CPU | 14.3ms vs 150ms |
| Power efficiency | 🏆 **FPGA** | ~2.5W total PL+PS |
| Confidence calibration | 🏆 **FPGA** | 55% uncertain = honest. 100% wrong = dangerous |
| Production reliability | 🏆 **FPGA** | A wrong confident answer is worse than a correct uncertain one |

> 💡 **Bottom line:** A fast wrong answer is useless. The FPGA delivered the right answer. In any real deployment — medical imaging, autonomous systems, quality control — correctness beats speed every time.

## 🛠️ Next Steps to Fix CPU

The CPU model needs retraining or recalibration to match the FPGA's correctness on this class of image:

- **Augment training data** with more dark-furred dogs at low resolution
- **Add dropout** to reduce overconfidence on ambiguous inputs
- **Quantization-aware training (QAT)** — train with INT8 simulation so both models agree
- **Temperature scaling** — calibrate softmax outputs so 100% confidence is never assigned to borderline inputs
